          Not a Bunch of Loads “Go ahead RJ, get the notebook out,” Tommy
          cackles. A bubble of beer hangs from his chin, but he doesn’t know
          about it. Four nights into the Replacements’ road trip and already
          things are getting ugly. The Replacements, four miscreants from
          Minneapolis, are setting up their equipment in a cafeteria at the
          Universi­ty of Windsor. Ill-humored after a pro­tracted shakedown at
          the border and feeling confrontational, they can’t get past the
          soundcheck before a guy with “student patrol” on his T-shirt complains
          about the volume. The alcohol the pro­moter foolishly left for them in
          the dress­ing room before the soundcheck only for­tifies their
          hostility. With me making eight (for a week) in their
          seats-six-comfortably Econoline, the Replacements are worming their
          way around the Midwest, out east, south to Georgia, and eventually to
          California, promoting their new album Let It Be. They figure they’ll
          come home broke as they left. The ride from the cafeteria to the hotel
          is a crusade — we get lost and then turn around only to get lost some
          more. Everybody’s babbling, everybody’s experienc­ing preshow panic:
          how can we get away with it tonight? The manifold sprang a leak first
          night out of Minneapolis, and it fills up the van with a carbon
          monoxide cloud. But the band’s already addled, so it’s no big deal.
          Guitarist Bob Stinson has hidden the scotch on singer Paul Westerberg.
          Not that there’s more than a trickle left to conceal. “You’re not
          going down on us tonight, are you?” shouts drummer Chris Mars, the
          only one keeping sober this trip, as he grabs Paul around the neck. “I
          am going down tonight without you if I have to,” Paul says, sounding a
          little sad at the prospect. “But it would be nice if we went down
          together.” That night, Paul finds security in num­bers. Almost
          everyone in the band is crocked by the time the show starts. Af­ter
          putting on lipstick and eyeliner, vase­lining back their hair, and
          donning hippie overalls, they open with a heavy metal version of “The
          Marine’s Hymn” and close by passing around instruments to one another
          and more or less anybody who’s interested. Somewhere in between Paul
          says, “Fuck this rock shit, we’re a jazz band from now on,” and the
          band grinds out a few minutes of Holiday Inn lounge fusion. All this
          to a stupefied crowd, half of which has already split. After the show
          Westerberg is rueful that the Replacements hadn’t flopped more
          profoundly — if only they’d tried a little harder. That’s later on
          that night, though. Back in the van, still trying to find the crummy
          little hotel, Paul spits into the footwell of the van. In his
          lacon­ic, cartoon voice that seems to merge the sound of those two
          great Norsemen, Wal­ter Mondale and Lars the Janitor, he says, “I feel
          like I’m in another country.”<br /><br />
          They like Hydrox bet­ter than Oreos, but good people won’t hold it
          against them. On a great night or on a shitty one (but not inbetween),
          the Replacements are the most exciting, soul-searching out there band
          around. Their newest record, Let It Be, encom­passes hot-blooded
          country and rockabil­ly, Randy Newman pop and the all-out white noise
          that was always hardcore’s deepest (and sometimes only) text. They’re
          as giddy as kids standing up in the front car of a roller-coaster; and
          yes, they toss their cookies routinely, getting down to disclosures —
          not just of bad nights on their knees, but of why they do this to
          themselves in the first place. And why anyone would do such miserable
          things. All of this told in the plainspeak of a high school dropout
          afraid he might die, or simply disappear, before he knew what to do
          with his life. There’s no hurricane’s eye with the Re­placements, just
          four forces pulling in different directions. Bassist Tommy Stinson,
          18, has an “I Love ET” sticker on his amp, proudly calls himself a
          John Waite fan, and is the only band member who passes for cute.
          Gaunt, mop-headed, he tries to look sharp on stage, with his scissor
          kicks and rock-star stances. But why he’s so lovable is that pretty
          soon he just looks like he’s hurting, as if he knows that posing for
          pictures isn’t going to save him from anything. He really is a kid
          growing up in a band, and when he screws up, the group’s usually
          paternal. In contrast to Tommy, his big brother Bob, 24, is pudgy and
          cheerfully non­-plussed most of the time. If he were a cartoon, his
          eyes might be asterisks; if a moose fell into his TV dinner, he’d just
          ask for another one. Most of what I learned about 23-year-­old drummer
          Chris Mars was from watching him work. Behind the drums he looks
          terrorized, teeth bared and eyes en­larged as if he were getting
          electroshock. He says even less than Bob, but his quiet isn’t puzzling
          — he’s clean-cut, almost in­visible. And then there’s singer Paul
          Westerberg, at 24 the most ambitious member of the band and the
          skinniest (there are fatter breadsticks around). “You should have seen
          him when I first met him,” his girlfriend says. “I thought he was
          going to die.” If Paul instigates a lot of the rabble-rousing, he
          doesn’t seem to enjoy it as much as his cohorts — he plays the
          sourpuss and the fool. Like the others, he never finished high school.
          <br /><br />
          “Yeah, I went to Catholic school all the way — all the way and
          nowhere,” he says. “I was constantly drunk and stoned, just messed
          with drugs and stuff. I did that all through high school, that’s why I
          think I have a real bitter attitude toward it now. It was the worst
          four years of my life. “It was also bad because they would send kids
          from [alcohol/drug] treatment there, supposedly getting a good
          atmosphere. So you would have like half these goody-goody rich kids
          and the other half were these fucking loads from the inner city. I
          mean, being drunk every day in typing class and by the time you get
          your paper out the drill’s over.” Part of the thrill of any
          Replacements show is that at any moment they may fall apart — fall on
          their face, fall off the stage, fall as they try to fly. They have no
          idea what success might be like, or how to crawl away from what they
          don’t like about their lives. And they know a plan doesn’t mean much
          by itself, not the way the pop marketplace is currently orga­nized. So
          most of all they caterwaul for all the stuff they don’t have and
          proclaim themselves the kind of wrecks that denial produces in the
          end. In short, the Re­placements are always making spectacles of
          themselves. Bob appreciates a good tutu, or a go-go skirt with a
          paisley top, as much as the next man. When the band played an all-ages
          show in Minneapolis to kick off their tour, he honored the event by
          wearing just a diaper, which kept com­ing undone as he walked around
          Minne­apolis after the concert. Why this is affecting, and why it’s a
          pisser, is that the Replacements never look more like themselves than
          when they’re trying to look like someone else. Painfully regular guys,
          they take the stage and totter in the direction of their idea of pop
          stars. The Replacements’ role models are the marginal refuse of late
          ’60s and early ’70s rock — acts reacting against rock’s newly
          arrived-at art status (T. Rex, Alice Cooper) or bands so natu­rally
          disposable (the Sweet, the Grass Roots) they went nowhere critically.
          Paul, the band’s principal writer, says watching the Raspberries on
          Rock Con­cert in 1974 made him want to play music in the first place.
          With nothing original to say — and knowing it — the Raspberries wanted
          to be big anyway. They weren’t going to lie about it, so they sang
          about like wanting a hit and feeling confused about their lives, and
          like how great all those bands in the ’60s were. The Re­placements
          weren’t the only fans to catch a dose of catscratch fever from Don
          Kirshner, but they’re one of the few bands who aren’t embarrassed
          about it. There’s another difference, too — Paul writes better than
          Eric Carmen.<br /><br />But the Replacements’ love of ’70s grunge is
          veined with something more complicated, something less pleasant to
          think about, than fond remembrances. In the van the morning after a
          show featur­ing scads of covers, roadie Bill Sullivan mused, “Those
          people last night, they didn’t understand. They thought you were
          making fun of them.” To which Westerberg said, “Well, we kinda are.”
          True, but only inasmuch as the Replace­ments were making fun of
          themselves. Doing a soundcheck in Kent, Ohio, the band lashed into a
          vicious version of Golden Earring’s “Radar Love,” and af­ter it broke
          apart Tommy leaned over to manager Peter Jesperson and said happi­ly
          (not smugly as some might suppose), “That was when dogshit was real
          dog­shit.” Denying that there’s more than dogshit in such a song, or
          in themselves, is a constant. I got on the van with the Replacements
          wanting to know how a band with no money provides for itself, and how
          this affects their attitude and performances. What I came away with —
          hell, it’s blatant every show, and it fills up the van faster than the
          carbon monoxide­ — was a penetrating sense of obstruction, of being
          blocked, that made them willing to gouge into themselves to remove
          what makes them feel like things. I learned to judge a Replacements
          show like a scary movie — chart the splatter. And there’s plenty of
          splatter, because these guys just naturally act like they’ve been
          barfed out of a particle accelerator. They are within the tradition of
          trouble­makers like Wynonie Harris or Jerry Lee Lewis, musicians who
          might flop or might instigate a riot and who do both for the same
          reason — to wipe the features off your face. The Replacements are
          balled-­up boluses of high hopes and low feelings, wildcat growls and
          boredom, longings they try to beat down with a stick but never quite
          can. It’s an unstable mix, and sometimes it pulls a show together,
          when it’s not pulling their lives apart.<br /><br />In 1979, the
          Stinson brothers were jamming with drummer Chris Mars at home —
          neighorhood kids, blammied and wailing on tunes by Ted Nugent and
          Aerosmith. (Tastes that haven’t disappeared by any means. Witness this
          exchange in the van, some­where between Boston and Providence. Bill
          Mack, driver/soundman, smirking while Elvis’s Sun Sessions blares from
          the box: “Aw, what is this shit?” Bob, “Yeah, turn it off. I’ve got
          this Johnny Winter tape.”) Paul Westerberg, a janitor at the time,
          would hear them through the basement window on his way back from work
          and hide in the bushes. Before Paul, the band was happy with the
          singer it had — truth is, sometimes they say they’d be happier if they
          still had him. Paul was enlisted strictly as a guitar player. “I went
          in and I was the lead guitar player. Bob was rhythm, and we had
          another singer that they all want­ed to keep,” Paul recalls. “He was a
          friend of mine, and I told him that I loved him but the band hated
          him.” A few pep talks like this and the singer left. “To this day, I
          don’t think he knows,” Paul says. The band started as the Impediments,
          and gig number one was in a halfway house for alcoholics. They came to
          the show pilled up and plowed and got thrown out. They were told they
          wouldn’t play again. The next day they became the Replacements. They
          issued the splendidly entitled Sorry Ma, Forgot To Take Out the Trash
          in 1981, and though it’s brutal enough to harpoon a seaful of Moby
          Jacks (punk cut with Johnny Thunders’s Heartbreak­ers), it also
          reveals Paul’s knack for pop vernacular. “Shiftless When Idle,” if
          they’d taken the time, might have turned a few heads as a single, and
          the accompanying 45, the gruesomely blue “If Only You Were Lonely,” is
          as moving a honky­tonk tune as this decade has produced. A year later,
          there was The Replacements Stink, an appeal to hardcore’s troops;
          gratifying blare, it’s also the least of their records. And while last
          year’s all-u-can-­eat genre-smashing Hootenanny was mightily confusing
          at first, its pastiche of folk hokum, blues, and thrash-a-go-go serves
          both as a provocation to their fans and as an homage to the music the
          band likes.

          <br /><br />After an all-night drive to Columbus, the Replacements are
          tired and jittery for their first show on the road. Stache’s, the club
          they’re playing, is tiny and covered with the green carpeting usually
          found on putt-putt courses. Westerberg discovered not too long ago
          that he has pleurisy, and tonight it’s dogging him, causing his chest
          muscles to bunch up like wire cables. Before the soundcheck, he calls
          his girlfriend — “I told her everything was fine, that we’re all
          okay,” he says. “Already lying to her,” Tommy responds. Halfway
          through the show, when they lace into Let It Be‘s magisterial ”16
          Blue,” and Paul is so excited he pushes Tommy out of the way to turn
          up his amp, the song crashes away. Soon they shred “Take Me Down to
          the Hospital,” about that first pleurisy attack, and it’s obvious
          everybody in the club is either a true believer or another candidate
          for the emergency room. Some nights the band won’t connect, and people
          stand around like they’re waiting for a pizza, and if you think about
          the R.E.M. song where the rank and file of clubdom are compared to
          pilgrims you’d laugh a black guffaw. But there’s no laughter tonight,
          unless you count the fun Tommy’s having shouting along on “Hospital.”
          There’s a shocked sound rolling around the four walls as the set ends.
          Nobody feels like a stranger. After the show, there’s time for
          anoth­er drink while the money is counted and the equipment gets put
          in the van. Tom­my’s made a friend he’ll have contempt for in the
          morning. Bill Sullivan’s got an electric cord in one hand, the other
          in a woman’s ass pocket. Paul’s nursing a carton of milk and just
          wants to get to sleep. Somebody passes out a fanzine, and somebody
          says the bar is closing. And always pressing some flesh, maybe in the
          back of his mind counting the drinks everybody’s having, is manager
          Peter Jesperson. The band’s relationship with their label, Twin/Tone,
          and with Jesperson, has evolved from accidental beginnings. Trying to
          get a gig at a Minne­apolis club, Paul took a tape to Jesperson, the
          club’s booker who was also part owner of Twin/T0ne, a local compa­ny
          the band had never heard of. After playing the demo, Jesperson offered
          to record them. He became their manager at their second show, Paul
          says, “because we didn’t want to talk to the asshole at the bar.” Late
          one night on the tour, outside a gyro joint, Bob complains about
          Jesper­son. He’s unhappy about how little the band makes, about
          Jesperson’s co-pro­duction on the new album. He says, “I just don’t
          know why he’s here.” “Because he liked us when nobody else did,” Paul
          replies. The support’s been important, but the band’s antsy for
          change. They have what Jesperson describes as a “loose but perpetual”
          contract with Twin/Tone (he re­fuses to say whether they have a
          written agreement). By the band’s account, they haven’t seen any money
          from their rec­ords. “You know, none of us are whizzes at math or
          anything,” Paul says. “And they say to us, ‘You’re welcome any time
          you want to come look at the books.’ Well, Christ, I don’t want to see
          a page full of figures. We say, ‘Where’s our mon­ey?’ Twin/Tone
          doesn’t spend enough money to make money. They spend enough to get it
          out, the smallest amount necessary. It’s all they have, they say. I
          don’t know where the money is.” Everyone on the tour collects a per
          diem, usually $15, though either a packed house or an empty one the
          night before can alter that. Twin/Tone fronted the group $500 to get
          out of town, which, along with the take from each show, is what the
          Replacements are rolling on. A band like the Replacements can expect
          to make anywhere from $200 to $1250 a gig. Once in a while — a single
          time in the week I traveled — Jesperson sends money home, to pay off
          the studio time, the pressing and mastering of the record, the van.
          But after springing for hotel rooms (this is the first tour the
          Replacements have not depended on the kindness of strangers for
          lodging) and gas and instru­ment and van repairs, there isn’t much
          scratch left. What they save up from their per diem is what the band
          members will take home. Out of this is born vari­ous strategies for
          economizing. Bob will politely ask anyone to buy him a drink. Paul
          sometimes eats about three bites a day. Occasionally there’s a splurge
          — a band-buy of food, say, or a case — which comes out of what
          Jesperson’s been holding.<br /><br />Which isn’t to say that the
          Replacements don’t make things hard for themselves. First, there’s the
          volume to consider, a prime reason some clubs decline to book them.
          Besides being one of the few acts to bring the cops to Maxwell’s for
          disturbing Hobo­ken’s nappytime, the Replacements have had a number of
          club managers yank the plug on them. Once in Oshkosh they were playing
          at 128 decibals, over the legal limit and as loud as the sound board
          could register, when an amp gave up with a column of smoke. The show
          ended, and they got extended applause. “The guy there keeps calling us
          to play there again,” Jesperson says with an amused look. Not always
          is the management so sensitive. At a Minneapolis show a man­ager came
          up to the front of the stage with a bouncer and shouted at Paul to
          either turn it down or get off. “Do we still get paid if we leave?” he
          asked, as the purple hose in the manager’s forehead throbbed a little
          more, and the band launched into “Shut Up,” only with Wes­terberg
          shouting, “Fuck you.” Other tales of terror: the Cleveland jinx
          (thrown out of two clubs, one because Bob pissed on stage); a show in
          Virginia, where a crowd of hardcore kids, mad be­cause the band
          delivered their patented “pussy” set (country covers and slow stuff
          served up to knee-jerk thrashers), took it out on the van; an Ann
          Arbor date, er, performance art piece, consist­ing basically of tuning
          up, falling down, and starting maybe 20 songs without completing a
          one. The point in running down this bad behavior isn’t in the details.
          I had heard many of these stories before, but it wasn’t until I was on
          the road with the Replace­ments that I began to see how depressing
          their untenable heap of ambitions and energy can get. Hootenanny sold
          only about 6000 copies, and they’re deep in the hole financing Let It
          Be. The record industry isn’t going to look at this band and see a
          stack of Krugerrands. When the Replacements came to New York and
          played for some a&r people at CBGB, they flopped. To me it seemed
          meaningful.<br /><br />New York was where they figured they’d be heard
          by some big label repre­sentatives — Warner Bros.’ Michael Hill was
          coming out and, because he was a fan, he had set up a meeting with the
          band once they got to town. According to Paul, nothing in particular
          happened. “I wasn’t expecting to sign a deal or noth­ing, at all.
          Basically we’re talking ‘in a few years.’ He didn’t say anything
          specif­ic at all. He just wanted to know if we had half a brain or if
          we were a bunch of loads. At this point he’d be embarrassed, it would
          be too much of a risk to bring some bigwig down and see these guys who
          could possibly fall on their face. “Last night [at CBGB] was a classic
          example. We went up there and did what we wanted to do, and they [the
          record industry] wanted us to play our best songs as best we could.
          And we didn’t feel like it. And so they figure, ‘They’re a small-time
          bunch of amateurs.’ That’s one way to look at it, and that’s partly
          true. But I think it’s also the spirit that makes rock exciting and
          immediate.” But if Paul and Jesperson say there were no big hopes for
          the meeting, I re­member the argument outside the gyro restaurant. Bob
          was complaining about the size of Twin/Tone’s operation. And I
          remember Paul saying, “Well, just wait until we get to New York. We’re
          going to talk to somebody from Warner Bros. there.” He wasn’t just
          placating an angry Bob. And then there was the show the night of the
          meeting with Hill. Shortly into the set Paul babbled, “You may have
          guessed tonight that we don’t want to play any of our own songs.” This
          was big­-league self-abuse: not the rocket ride that can make their
          covers go bang, more like an extended submarine fart. The audi­ence
          was howling at them, and the band couldn’t come up with anything to
          shout back. Finally, they stumbled into the Stones’ “Start Me Up,”
          with shit-eating grins I would swear were slapped over some raw
          feelings. And then Paul said into the mike, “Do we get a record
          con­tract now?” No, but Hill did say he had tried to get Rod Stewart
          to cover “16 Blue.”<br /><br />In the end, to be hon­est, the
          Replace­ments have to dis­tinguish what they want from what they want.
          They have folks on their side like R.E.M. and X, bands who talk them
          up in interviews. The last time the Replacements opened for X, the
          headlin­er added part of their own take to the Replacements’ cut.
          There is support for the band, and in their calmer moments they think
          they just have to find a way to stick together and keep on sucking
          car­bon mono before they start generating cash from it all. Except
          that there’s a song on Let It Be called “Unsatisfied” that questions
          what success will mean. When Paul sings “Everything you ever dream of,
          it’s right in front of you,” he’s not even teenage-miserable. He feels
          cleaned out like a fish, worrying that fans or money or some such shit
          won’t make him feel any better about himself — that his depression
          will last a long time, may­be until the permanent vacation. Still, the
          Replacements deserve every consumer good they can cram down their
          cakehole, and it will be a more just world which will give them merely
          some of that. And an even juster one that will ease the vacancy that
          bunches up their chest mus­cles. But for now they have to contend with
          the fear of defeat that one way or another works its way to the
          surface of any great Replacements show and that sometimes gets broken
          in their effort. And sometimes that fear just lays low, nibbles away
          at the band until they feel there’s nothing to do but get fucked up.
          That’s the way it was for the great trek through Canada. Driving from
          Windsor to Rochester through Ontario was the longest time I spent in
          the van with them. Fortified with more alcoholic Ca­nadian beer, they
          were mostly wrecked. There was tag team wrestling in the back — when
          we got to Rochester the proper response belonged to Bob, who lobbed a
          smoke bomb into the van and might have burned it down.<br /><br />
          It was fun. But better than fun was the larger-than-life wrestling
          with boredom that went down a few nights before in Kent, Ohio. We were
          at JB’s, a large, hops-soaked basement where, the band was told, Alice
          Cooper had played 15 years earlier. There was no sign for the place
          outside. The show wobbled at first, the band playing material from Let
          It Be not particularly well. Then something like the hootch and
          something like panic began to lay a finger on them. Songs started
          crumbling after a few bars; there was no agreement about what to play.
          “Hey, let’s pick a chord, guys,” Paul said. Nobody did. And then, to
          Bob, “Hey, you’re the guitar player,” trying to make him pick a song.
          So they tuned up for a few minutes instead. Plink, plink. “We’d talk
          to you be­tween songs, but we’re not any good at it.” And then Paul
          cackled out of the side of his mouth, “Bob will start this next one
          for you right now. Watch him. Now … ” The audience had long ago
          stopped laughing at the patter. Now they’re yell­ing things like “Bark
          my hole” and “Fuck you.” Finally Chris kicked into the drum intro to
          “Billion Dollar Babies,” which made it nearly to the part where the
          vo­cal was supposed to come in before every­body in the band started
          cracking up too much to play. Plink. “We can do this all night,” Paul
          hooted. No shit. There was an empty dance floor in front of the band.
          And suddenly the rest of the place was thinning out, too. What Paul
          once said on another stage must be running through his mind: “I can
          see some of you are still here. That means our work is not finished.”
          What followed, at a glance, was family-sized loathing — ­for
          themselves and for the audience, need it be said. But as they fell
          down the cis­tern, something pretty strange was also happening. The
          band essayed Bad Com­pany’s “Can’t Get Enough,” and the crowd wasn’t
          articulating too much any­more, they were making crueler animal-­like
          sounds. Next up was “Taking Care of Business,” only the real joke was
          it was a monster, and all at once the band wasn’t laughing exactly.
          They were … smiling. Hell, beaming. This was suddenly, unex­pectedly,
          really fun.<br /><br />And for as long as they kept officious­ness at
          bay, they were not even precisely the Replacements, they were just
          fans. When they took on “Roundabout,” Bob was smiling as much as he
          had the whole week, and he glowed throughout the Jose Feliciano, the
          DeFranco Family. I think they may have played some of their own stuff
          here, oh, and “Walk on the Wild Side.” Greil Marcus writes approvingly
          about Sonic Youth making rock so crude it was almost noise, but at
          JB’s the Replacements made Sonic Youth sound like the Dillards. This
          was gap-toothed noise laughing at music. It had been a while since the
          people who had thrown lit ciga­rettes and cans of soup and toilet
          paper had left, and everybody else now was ei­ther just tired, or, I
          think, subtly paci­fied. And happy, too. “My Sharona” came then, and
          when I looked over, I saw the bartender shaking a tambourine and
          bopping from one end of the bar to the other. Eventually they got to
          “Breakdown,” and Jesperson sang every word from the back of the room.
          And then, pretty quickly, they found a way back, maybe found a new
          way, to being Replacements once again. And when they wailed on
          “Johnny’s Gonna Die,” it was maybe more fucked-up, and more moving,
          than ever. A friend in Ann Arbor a night later would tell me the
          Replacements were great because they had so many “objective
          correlatives” poking out of every song, like shrapnel in some Vili
          nail fetish, and maybe here was the biggest example of all. Westerberg
          at 20 writing about role-model Johnny Thunders, how his update of Hank
          Wil­liams’s life was appealing, and terminal. Built on the chords to
          “So You Want To Be a Rock and Roll Star,” “Johnny” is a kid meditating
          on what’s not a kid’s theme: that what he loves — and it’s not really
          junk, it’s speed, wide-eyed and no pauses — may kill him. The
          Replacements are crucial because they proclaim their hunger, and they
          don’t shut up. From the mournful din of “Johnny” to Let It Be‘s
          expansive, calamitous variety, they’ve been even smarter than they
          have been stoopid. Nobody else left once things got inter­esting at
          JB’s, but the band was getting tired. Still, the set never really
          “ended.” Somebody left the stage, Tommy and Bob sat down on the edge,
          and roadie Bill Sullivan took the mike to say, “Once again we’d like
          to thank you for that big Ohio welcome.” It cleared out briskly after
          that. ❖ This article from the Village Voice Archive was posted on
