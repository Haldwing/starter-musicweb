          We may never stop trying to fix the Replacements. Few bands’ legacies
          inspire such fervent choruses of “could have been”; few bands’
          biographies holler back “no way in hell” with such finality. I defy
          you to find a possible turning point in Trouble Boys, Bob Mehr’s
          definitive Mats chronicle, where the willfully haphazard Minneapolis
          crew, had they only momentarily overcome their thrashed-about
          fuckuppery, could have immunized their career from future
          self-sabotage. Yet still, Tim (Let It Bleed Edition), a four-disc box
          set featuring a celebrated new mix of their 1985 Sire Records debut,
          is so thrilling that wistful fans are once more left puzzling through
          a cruel paradox: The Replacements could have been famous if only they
          hadn’t been the Replacements.<br /><br />
          We’ve been here before. In 2019, a salvage job on the band’s
          last-ditch 1989 nosedive into the mainstream, Don’t Tell a Soul, was
          released as part of the Dead Man’s Pop box set. While spiking the
          sound to meet fans’ unkempt standards, the new version couldn’t render
          a (relatively) weak batch of songs into lost classics. (A "deluxe"
          edition of 1987’s Pleased to Meet Me the following year, though
          worthwhile for fans, promised fewer revelations.) But Tim? Tim is a
          whole ’nother story. Even as someone who spent the ’80s listening to
          dubbed Maxells of my friends’ LPs, a guy who didn’t own a CD player
          till after the Berlin Wall fell, my take was “great songs, shame about
          the mix” long before I learned that was the conventional wisdom.
          <br /><br />The Replacements were hardly the only up-from-indie band
          of their time flummoxed by the studio—in Hüsker Dü’s SST days, Grant
          Hart often sounded like he was drumming on a cereal box. But while
          major labels often garishly brightened an underground band’s sound for
          commercial appeal, Tommy Erdelyi (better known as Tommy Ramone)
          imprisoned Tim within an echo chamber of murk, adding shadows but no
          mystery, imposing a strange distance on songs that were so essential
          we willed ourselves across the gap, as though fiddling with our radio
          dial to catch some fading far-off signal. No doubt, the dynamic new Ed
          Stasium remaster is what I’ll cue up whenever I want to hear those
          songs again. The mix does posthumous justice to the increasingly
          unsteady guitarist Bob Stinson, benched by Westerberg for most of the
          sessions. His still too-few demented prog-punk lines now wend
          unpredictably within earshot rather than milling about in the back of
          the room. The rhythm section kicks and swings with more abandon, and
          Westerberg's own guitars now chug inventively underneath or hang
          reverberant in the air, no longer bound like overly padded boxing
          gloves. <br /><br />You don’t have to be a historicist to complain
          that a few early fade-ins and late fade-outs are distracting—the
          spoken intro to “Waitress in the Sky,” the stray guitar string thumps
          that close “Bastards of Young.” But whatever lyrics you once strained
          to hear (oh, so that’s "Uncle Henry, Auntie Em" Paul's muttering
          during the break on “One Good Dose of Thunder”) had nothing to do
          Westerberg’s lack of articulation. And as with all such overhauls, you
          listen closer to music that’s grown overly familiar—I hear touches I
          could have sworn were newly exhumed that are plainly audible in the
          earlier mix. I’ll leave it to rock essentialists to debate about which
          is the “real” mix. The Erdelyi version remains a historical document,
          available for archivists, sticklers, or whoever’s had that earlier
          edition's tinny reverb imprinted on their soul. This new version may
          or may not represent how the Replacements wanted Tim to
          sound—intention is hard enough to determine in the moment let alone
          from the distance of decades. I’ll even accept (without caring about
          the implications) the argument that it presents a too-idealized
          Replacements, extracted from the messiness of history. But I get
          impatient when I hear folks wax hypothetical about what a record that
          sounded like this in 1985 would have had on the band’s
          career—especially since I wonder that myself. <br /><br />Because at
          this late date, really, why should anyone give a fuck if the
          Replacements had become big rock stars? Surely enough people love the
          Replacements already. Maybe Minnesotans have the excuse of civic
          self-worth tied up in the Mats’ fate—Paul Westerberg is our Scott
          Norwood, our Bill Buckner, local rock's goat and its GOAT—though I’m
          still not sure that’s a healthy way to live. But settle down, the rest
          of you. Play that tape all the way through and just look at where it
          leads. These guys handled notoriety so badly, just imagine what actual
          fame would have done to them. Anyway, they lasted a decade, and not
          many bands thrive for long beyond that. It’s a fatalist sickness to
          savor the supposedly apt poetic injustice of it all—the Replacements
          were just too great to be mere stars, pfft. But that’s no reason to
          nurse the belief that, with the right song, at the right time, they
          could have been as big as… the Georgia Satellites, maybe?
          <br /><br />It can seem an impossible feat to separate the band’s
          music from its lore. But what if, summoning unprecedented stores of
          psychic effort, we listened to Tim as just one of the many major label
          records cut by underground strivers in the last decades of the 20th
          century that never went anywhere commercially. After all, if you were
          born after the Replacements dissolved, that’s basically what Tim is.
          <br /><br />Come in fresh like that and you’ll hear some guys rocking
          with steadfast assurance of a band that’s far from doomed. With an
          unreal balance of chaos and craft, they seem to stumble across the
          song structures upon which the music industry would later lucratively
          construct alt-rock. “Hold My Life” alone sounds like a microcosm of
          1994, a blueprint the Replacements could have fashioned the rest of
          the album from. Instead there’s the Stonesy tumble of “Lay It Down
          Clown,” the druggy, shoutalong metal of “One Good Dose of Thunder,”
          the brawny yet abject swagger of “I’ll Buy,” and the snarky country
          shuffle of “Waitress in the Sky,” in which lumpenproles lash out at
          unionized labor (and girls, of course) for the sake of a good
          joke—without (I think?) becoming Reaganists. <br /><br />Long before
          quiet verse/loud chorus became modern rock cliché, the Mats upended
          that convention with the quiet-then-loud verses of the chorusless
          “Left of the Dial,” culminating in a final verse at full, reckless
          volume that drifts into a rueful coda. “Which side are you on?”
          Westerberg asks (himself?) cryptically throughout that song, and even
          if we’re still pretending to know nothing about this band (though are
          we even?), moments like this mark Tim as a crossroads of an album.
          “Time for a decision to be made,” he'd declared earlier on “Hold My
          Life” even as he seemed to hold out hope that Mr. Wizard would rescue
          him. In Westerberg’s nicotine-tinctured voice, you’ll hear why the
          Replacements couldn’t be just another band for so many. Yet his lyrics
          evade the commitment with which he sings. A year earlier, “I Will
          Dare” swung with such assurance that you could miss how safe Paul was
          playing it. If you will dare, then I might dare. This is a note
          slipped secretly into a locker, a dare to dare, an invitation for you
          to jump first and I’ll follow, I swear. It’s less “I Want to Hold Your
          Hand” than “I Want You to Hold My Hand.” It’s “Thunder Road” if Bruce
          had left a message on Mary’s answering machine asking her to swing by
          and pick him up after work—but like, if not, that’s cool, no
          pressure.<br /><br />
          A tension between emotional paralysis and desperate, misguided action
          runs throughout Tim. Elvis Costello made entire albums without a pun
          as good as “Swingin’ Party,” one of rock’s greatest songs about that
          most un-rock quality, shyness. The corrosive helplessness of being
          unable to budge, to overcome your inner blocks, that the song captures
          so well is what makes the impulsive PDA of “Kiss Me on the Bus” so
          necessary, even triumphant. That push-and-pull between self-protective
          caution and self-destructive abandon might explain why “Can’t Hardly
          Wait” didn’t surface on Tim. It’s a song so undeniable that you can
          trick yourself into thinking it was the last puzzle piece missing, and
          the often slapdash Westerberg agonized over multiple versions (you can
          hear four on the outtakes disc of the new box) before determining that
          it just wasn’t ready for the world. But it’s-not-quite-there
          perfectionism is just the flipside of fuck-it-it’s-fine. If the end
          result will always disappoint you, there’s no reason to try. You may
          as well jump right in and make a mess of shit.<br /><br />
          So much is made in retrospect about Westerberg's "fear of success,"
          but really, what non-idiot under 30 in 1985 wouldn’t feel conflicted
          about rock stardom? (Well, besides Prince.) Elvis is a no-show—he’s in
          the ground, as Westerberg sings—and who’d look at Jagger shimmying
          alongside a leopard-skinned Bowie to a desecration of “Dancing in the
          Streets” and think, yeah, that’s what I’m shooting for? Who could
          listen back then to the raw punk singles that Peter Jesperson had
          exposed the young Mats to at Oarfolk without realizing that their
          promise had gone unrealized? His excesses romantic rather than
          hedonist, Westerberg sang with an ache of inchoate desire, a
          desperation for some non-stupid reason to rock out. Tim is what it’s
          like to be cursed with the gift of waxing eloquent about how you don’t
          know what to say, what it’s like to recognize that all the goals set
          before you are inane, yet to be so infatuated by the raw power of an
          electric guitar that you can never fully accept that the noise you
          make is meaningless. <br /><br />Tim has always been a fall record for
          me. This time each year my all-too-literal brain notices the longer
          late afternoon shadows and the earlier sunsets and the shriveled
          patches in my backyard where even the weeds have lost the will to
          sprawl and I hear Paul Westerberg murmur “The summer’s past/It’s too
          late to cut the grass” from “Here Comes a Regular.” Somehow it’s 1985
          all over again for me even though I wouldn’t hear that song for a few
          years after that. Memory’s funny that way. Then again, there was
          something autumnal about growing up in the ’80s. All the sex had been
          fucked. All the drugs cost too much. All the rock had been rolled. Our
          inheritance was AIDS and whip-its and Bon Jovi. We were forever being
          told the party was long over but you could sneak downstairs and drink
          the backwashed dregs from one of your parents’ warm unfinished beers
          and hope no one had doused a cigarette butt in it. <br /><br />Maybe
          that’s just how every 15-year-old has felt forever. Certainly few
          rockers have ever felt as 15-for-life as Westerberg. On Let It Be he
          channeled the cranky old man nestled inside every disaffected kid,
          eternally wronged and romantically inept and blasting out blame like
          buckshot at MTV and answering machines and tonsillectomies. That
          resentment was more focused on Tim, where the exasperation of being
          born too late reached its fullest expression on “Bastards of Young.”
          Sometime in the next decade, when media marketers tried to peg me and
          my contemporaries as “Generation X” so they could figure out what ads
          we liked, I’d think back to Paul sneering “ya got no warrant to name
          us” (a line I’d mistaken in the past for “war to name us” or even
          “maim us”—Tim is among rock’s great troves of misheard lyrics). Yeah,
          I'd think. That means you, Time magazine! <br /><br />Yes, we project
          so much of our own baggage on the Replacements, and that includes our
          feelings of and about regret. No one makes it to 40 without a litany
          of what we have done and what we have failed to do haunting us. And
          the Replacements are our Ghost of Modern Rock Past, a reminder of
          missteps as ephemeral as a kiss left unkissed and as quotidian as that
          ill-timed second mortgage. It’s almost enough to imagine the Stasium
          mix of Tim duking it out with Bryan Adams or Dire Straits for the top
          of the Billboard charts, without realizing what a sad victory that
          would have been. And so we beat on, boats against the current, blah
          blah friggin’ blah, to quote some other Minnesota drunk who knew a
          little something about regret, who we also remember as never
          surpassing his early successes. Fitzgerald flailed about in Hollywood
          and died young. Hackwork didn’t come naturally to Westerberg either,
          and he settled instead into Edina semi-anonymity. The Great Gatsby
          remains a great book. Tim is still a great record. Yet both are the
          same kind of works that make us demand more from their creators, that
          forever leave us unsatisfied.
