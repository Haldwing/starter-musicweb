          Like so many other Replacements fans, no doubt, the first thing I did
          with the new version of Tim was skip right to “Left of the Dial.” One
          of those “bury my soul in these guitars” songs that any music fan
          collects over time. It’s a highlight of the classic 1985 album from
          four Minnesota punk boys, the great American rock band of the
          Eighties. “Left of the Dial” is the Replacement’s most heart-on-fire
          confession, a rager about losing your friends over time, missing them
          over the miles, until you turn on the car radio and get jumped by that
          stupid tune you used to sing together. Every note in this damn song
          triggers a neural rush. But now, every note is different. In Tim: The
          “Let It Bleed” Sessions, a new Ed Stasium remix finally cleans up the
          murk on one of rock’s most infamous production disasters. There’s so
          much more to this music than any of us knew—so many details that got
          lost until now. In “Left of the Dial,” it’s the rasp and crackle in
          Paul Westerberg’s ravaged throat. It’s the live-wire buzz of Bob
          Stinson’s guitar, which you can now actually hear. Sometimes the new
          mix sounds too busy — at the end, when kid brother Tommy Stinson plays
          his poignant bass throb, he gets drowned out. But you hear Westerberg
          sing and hum and moan to himself in the final minute, as if he’s so
          swept up in this tale he forgot his mic was on. It’s insane that this
          exists now. Listening to the new Tim is full of these revelations.
          It’s like watching Get Back, the moment where Paul sits at the piano
          to play “Strawberry Fields Forever” and John plucks his guitar, both
          pretending this is no big deal, not fooling anyone. You think, “Wait,
          these details were buried in a vault all these years? This music, this
          history, it’s all different?” <br /><br />The four-CD Rhino box is
          full of alternate takes, demos, live slop, notes from legendary band
          biographer Bob Mehr. It turns Tim into a whole new trip, packed with
          twists no fan could prepare for. New stories and surprises leap out of
          every riff. This will take some time to process. It’s why the indie
          rockers in your life are a bit messy right now. Tim has always been
          their most polarizing album, the one you can always use to start an
          argument in a bar. (And boy, do Replacements fans love arguing in
          bars.) Great songs. Lousy production. For many fans, a total letdown
          after their 1984 masterpiece, Let It Be. The sound got muffled, with
          lead guitarist Bob Stinson barely audible. Tommy Erdelyi seemed like a
          cool choice for producer, since he was also the great Tommy Ramone.
          But he wasn’t such an experienced producer, beyond his own band, and
          this job was way over his head. He ended up flattening the Mats, with
          a feeble mix that sounded soggy, drenched in digital reverb, devoid of
          guitar dynamics. Even Chris Mars’ drums turned to mush. But Tim is
          also an undeniable classic. It breaks down into three mighty songs
          (“Kiss Me on the Bus,” “I’ll Buy,” “Little Mascara”), two really
          mighty songs (“Hold My Life,” Bastards of Young”), two of the most
          soul-stompingly perfect songs in rock & roll or human history
          (“Swingin Party,” “Left of the Dial”), then a powerhouse acoustic
          finale that kicks you in the teeth while you watch your twenties swirl
          down the drain like the last dribbles out of an empty bottle (“Here
          Comes a Regular”). Plus a droll goof with staying power, “Waitress in
          the Sky.” Just for variety, two terrible songs: “Dose of Thunder” on
          Side One and “Lay It Down Clown” on Side Two. Then there’s “Nowhere Is
          My Home,” which would have been the best thing on the album, except
          for some insane reason it didn’t make the cut. Neither did “Can’t
          Hardly Wait,” which would’ve come in third. Fans were startled not to
          see it on Tim, since it was the highlight from the band’s live
          cassette,The Shit Hits the Fans. A wild November 1984 show in
          Oklahoma, sounding as raw as you’d expect from Paul’s liner notes:
          “Our roadie pulled it out of some enterprising young gent’s tape
          recorder at the end of the night. (Drop us a line, buddy, there’s
          $3.95 in it for you!)” Westerberg sings the Jackson 5’s “I’ll Be
          There” like a prayer, urging the audience to “come closer!” But “Can’t
          Hardly Wait” remains a stunner, still the most intense version, a
          breakneck punk peel-out with all four racing to the finish line like
          the next six-pack depends on it. This didn’t make the album? What the
          hell happened? Stasium does a heroic salvage job on Tim, finally doing
          justice to these songs. Stasium was an old Ramones comrade — he
          engineered Ramones Leave Home and Rocket to Russia in 1977, and
          produced Road to Ruin in 1979 with Erdelyi. He adds loads of guitar
          mayhem from both Westerberg and Stinson. Each song is full of lost
          flourishes — Westerberg’s grunts and yelps (from “I’ll Buy” to
          “Swingin Party”), the extra guitar in “Swingin Party,” the piano and
          strings on “Here Comes a Regular.” Bob always haunted these songs by
          his absence — but now he’s finally in the mix, as he always should
          have been, a vital creative force like he was on the Tim tour. He gets
          to step out in “Little Mascara,” which has a whole new extra minute at
          the end. Bob cuts loose on guitar, adding his bittersweet sympathy to
          a song already dripping with it.

          <br /><br />There are always beloved albums that get botched in the
          studio, whether it’s the Stooges’ Raw Power, David Bowie’s Earthling,
          Mary J. Blige’s Stronger With Each Tear, The Chills’ Brave Words,
          Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers’ L.A.M.F. — all great albums
          badly recorded. But what do you do when a remix changes the story? It
          happened when Iggy Pop remixed Raw Power in 1997, bringing the buried
          sonic details to life. No matter how much sentimental fondness you had
          for the old mix, this one was now the real Raw Power. Same thing with
          Taylor Swift redoing Red, except no sonic flaws to fix — the new Red
          was suddenly the real thing. Paul Westerberg has so much in common
          with Taylor — the emotional realness of their songs, their love of
          melodrama, their tendency to leave genius songs off the damn album.
          Both love to casually drop a bombshell confession mid-song, then
          stroll away — it’s so Westerbergian when Taylor tosses “leavin’ like a
          father” into “Cardigan,” just as Paul slips “you wonder to yourself if
          you might be gay” into “Sixteen Blue.” (Gen X’s “Fifteen.”)
          “Mirrorball” and “Swingin Party” are flip sides of the same late-night
          heartbreak. Taylor’s most Replacements-ish song is “Ours,” which would
          fit perfectly on Pleased to Meet Me, the same way his Swiftian “Little
          Mascara” would fit into the Unhappily Ever After trilogy on Evermore.
          But one thing they have in common is they just took world-beatingly
          classic albums and made them better. Tim (The “Let It Bleed” Edition)
          is like Red (Taylor’s Version), where a soundtrack-of-your-life album
          gets tweaked and makes you completely re-evaluate your long history
          with this music. It forces you to let go a lot of things you thought
          you knew about these artists. <br /><br />The Replacements have gotten
          burdened with the mythos of a sob story, a woulda-coulda-shoulda band
          of beautiful losers who tumbled off the ladder of success, boo hoo. A
          cute narrative, and it’s easy to see why journalists cling to it, but
          not the least bit adequate or accurate as a framework for these songs.
          The self-pity in their music is run-of-the-mill, but the exhilaration
          and desolation and honesty and we’re-coming-out exuberance — that
          part’s unique. It’s a corny cliché to sniffle that a band this weird
          didn’t go mainstream. The real shocker is that these four boys ever
          found each other, that they ever made this noise, that so many people
          then and now hear ourselves in it. Case in point: their Saturday Night
          Live gig in January 1986, a triumph that blew the minds of the lucky
          ones who saw it. (Few did — not exactly a golden era for the
          franchise.) The best SNL music performance ever at that point, by a
          mile, and still one of the best ever, four punks banging out “Bastards
          of Young” and “Kiss Me on the Bus” in their Seventies nerd-wear. A
          glorious life-affirming racket that makes you want to jump off the
          couch and tell all your friends or create your own art or just dance
          around and play air guitar. But when people talk about it now (even
          the ex-Replacements) all they remember is how it hurt Lorne Michaels’
          feelings, which couldn’t be less the point. If you haven’t actually
          seen it, go ahead and watch. I guarantee you will not spend a moment
          thinking about how Lorne felt. The new Tim challenges that whole
          narrative. It captures their music’s ecstatic highs and harrowing
          lows, from the back-to-school romance of “Kiss Me on the Bus” to the
          alcoholic despair of “Here Comes a Regular.” Plenty of people heard
          this album and wanted to start their own bands. Westerberg had advice
          for them. “Don’t put an ad in the paper,” he said in Rolling Stone in
          early 1986. “Just find some friends that you share something in common
          with—partying, a brand of beer. That’s better than being a member of a
          band for three years, making it and doing it all with someone you
          don’t really know. If all this falls to hell, I still have three
          friends. And that’s good enough for me.” That was the spirit of Tim
          right there. Those words had a pretty major impact on my life, like
          these songs. The bitter irony, of course: a few months later, they
          kicked Bob out of the band, to replace him with a slicker pro they
          didn’t know. His name was Bob, too, so they made him change it to
          Slim, to avoid reminding themselves of the regular they left behind.
          (Bob Stinson died from drug-related organ failure in 1995.) But that
          story’s in this music too. “They call your name out loud and clear” —
          now there’s a line that got messy fast. “Nowhere Is My Home” is still
          the showstopper, with a high-energy alternate romp. But it’s best in
          the original 1985 outtake — the Stasium remix is busier, stepping on
          the Bob Stinson third-rail guitar that tells most of the story.
          <br /><br />
          “Swingin Party” takes on new dimensions, with added twang; very
          different, but equally essential. Like most Replacements fans, I was
          too theatrically illiterate to hear the connection to the Rodgers/Hart
          standard “Where or When.” (That took Bryan Ferry’s version of “Where
          or When,” where he gives it the “Swingin Party” arrangement.) But it’s
          now the most famous Tim song, thanks to Lorde’s brilliantly melancholy
          cover, where she gives this song the pop reach it always deserved. The
          heart of the album is “Bastards of Young,” where he sings, “The ones
          who love us best are the ones we’ll lay to rest/And visit their graves
          on holidays at best/The ones who love us least are the ones we’ll die
          to please/If it’s any consolation, I don’t begin to understand them.”
          It’s no consolation at all, actually — the empathy in his voice trails
          off before he even gets through “understand.” He just spills a bleak
          confession, then lunges the other way to avoid eye contact. But like
          so many moments on Tim, this one follows you around through the years.
          As for the two terrible songs, they sound marginally improved, still
          pitifully overmatched by the rest — no surprise when you consider how
          few bands ever write a song that could hang on Tim. “Waitress” is fine
          as a comic sorbet to cleanse the palate between tearjerkers, like
          “Vicar in a Tutu” on the Smiths’ The Queen Is Dead. There’s also a
          nifty 1986 Chicago Iive show, a couple notches below the excellent For
          Sale: Live at Maxwell’s 1986, or various other ’84-’86 shows floating
          around. (Wonder if Stasium will have a bash at 6/17/86?) The live set
          showcases Bob’s virtuosity at rock & roll trash. His 1966-not-1965
          Lennon guitar in “Nowhere Man” is as eloquent as his 1972-not-1969
          Mick Taylor in “Jumpin’ Jack Flash.” “Nowhere Man” also taps into the
          ever-strange John/Paul connection. You can hear the Lennon chill in
          Paul’s voice, especially in “Here Comes a Regular,” when he sighs,
          “Once the police made you go away.”
          <br /><br />
          Tim sold 75,000 copies, a phenomenal total for a Minnesota punk band
          playing bars with no hits, no video, no NYC/L.A. connection, terrible
          production, nothing going for them but great press. Yet for some
          reason, this seemed like a shocking flop to a band who sincerely
          thought Tim would make them mainstream mega-stars. While everybody saw
          the Replacements as successful peers to Hüsker Dü, Meat Puppets, the
          Minutemen, they saw themselves as failed rivals to U2 or R.E.M. That’s
          one of the most depressing discoveries in Mehr’s excellent bio Trouble
          Boys — which has to hold the rock-book record for most depressing
          discoveries per page. The Mats finally got popular in the grunge
          Nineties, thanks to Nirvana (plus Heathers, Say Anything, Singles).
          Tim, more than any of their records, prefigured the 1990s rock boom
          that made these guys posthumous legends. But they seemed to want no
          part of it. To them, this album was just another grave for the kids to
          visit on holidays at best. At a certain point in my 30s, Tim overtook
          Let It Be as my favorite Replacements album, a change I definitely
          didn’t plan on or see coming. When I realized Tim had slipped past Let
          It Be, I felt cheated, like this was a major life decision made behind
          my back. But it hits deeper over the years — the rugged power-trio
          format suits the hard-ass tone of the songs. So only time will tell if
          the new “Left of the Dial” tops the original. I won’t know for sure
          until I hear it on an Arizona highway in 110 degree heat, pull over
          into a gas station so I can scream it at the rear-view for a long-gone
          friend out in San Francisco, definitely not L.A., even though I still
          have many hours’ driving left for tonight’s Taylor Swift show, where
          she will sing “All Too Well” for the only time that tour. “Can’t
          Hardly Wait” might be the ultimate Tim song — what could sum up the
          Replacements’ spirit better than the song that gets dumped in a ditch
          for being too awesome? Like “Silver Springs” from Rumours, it’s the
          outtake that ends up defining the project. “Can’t Hardly Wait” makes a
          few appearances here. The previously unreleased Cello Version is a
          clever twist, kinda like the horn-section rendition eventually
          released on Pleased to Meet Me. But both feel like variations on a
          theme rather than the actual song. You get closer to the real thing
          with the “Tim Version” outtake, newly Stasiumized, buried near the end
          of Disc Three. Great, yet not as slashing as the already-released “Tim
          Version,” which is still a touch too slow. So it’s not quite a
          definitive or final “Can’t Hardly Wait.” But it’s fitting that this
          restless-heart road trip of a song never gets a proper home, just
          wandering from version to version, each one telling a different tale.
          The most emotionally powerful “Can’t Hardly Wait” — and fastest, not a
          coincidence — is still the one on The Shit Hits the Fans, for my
          money. It’s still the one I play when I want to hear a bunch of lonely
          boys in the Midwestern winter try to cheer each other up, by playing a
          dumb song about a long drive that never ends. It’s a bunch of losers
          banding together against the world, refusing to get beat down. It’s a
          bar band refusing to go through the motions, refusing to let anyone
          stand in the back with arms folded and play cool. A brotherhood making
          demands, cracking dirty jokes that double as philosophical challenges.
          The singer is tired of tonight; the guitarist, bassist, and especially
          drummer can’t hardly wait for tomorrow. The band speeds up at the end,
          with Paul chanting “no I can’t wuuh-haayt!” while Bob goes off the
          guitar guardrails. Three minutes, that’s it, but you’re not the same
          when it’s over—any attitude you brought into it gets trampled in the
          dust. It’s a song that laughs at your self-pity and dares you to dare.
          In so many ways, that’s the whole story of this album and this band.
          The Replacements and their audience built something that lasted, and
          it’s never sounded louder than in the new Tim. The songs that love us
          best, never laid to rest.
